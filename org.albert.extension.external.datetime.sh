# This extension shows the current date and time.
# To use this extension, type the trigger word "date" in Albert.

# The available actions copy
# - date in ISO format (e.g. 2017-09-10),
# - the full date and time (as displayed), or
# - a timestamp
# to the X clipboard. You can use Ctrl+V to paste it in other applications.
# I find the date and timestamp useful for naming files (amongst others use cases).

# Dependencies: The enclosed bash script xclip-in-1st-arg must be in the PATH.

# Known problems:
# - If no action is executed and Albert shows up again, it still displays the
#   old time. Type "date" again to refresh.
# - Although the day name is localized by Albert's environment (environment
#   variables LANG or LC_*), the displayed date format is not.

# Why I added just these actions:
# - Date in ISO format: international standard, sorts nicely, useful for
#   filling out forms and naming files.
# - Full date and time: might be useful when you need the full date, day, time,
#   or parts thereof.
# - Timestamp with dashes: not readable without dashes; with colons in the
#   time, it would be unsuitable for filenames.
# - No "copy time only" action because I cannot think of a use case.
