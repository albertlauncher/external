### This is the official repository for external extensions.

Clone the repository and pull from time to time or download single extensions. Check the [docs](https://albertlauncher.github.io/docs/extending/external/) on external extensions.

To install the extensions in user space type the following in your terminal:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:albertlauncher/external.git "~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.externalextensions/extensions"
```

We do not have the time to take care of packaging compiled external extensions for all platforms out there. If you want to share your extension, please use one of the dozens of script languages out there.

This is mainly a users maintained repo. If you send a PR I'll invite you to the reviewers team (if I dont forget it), I'd appreciate if you could review others contributions.
